Render Problems - Debugging exercise

You have been given a small application from a co-worker who is trying to learn how to use render props.  They tell you that the functionality they are trying to build is a edit button that toggles a form. Then if the user puts information into the form and click submit, it should pop and alert up on the screen.

Unfortunately, the application is broken.  You are asked to clone down the repository and fix the bugs for your co-worker.
